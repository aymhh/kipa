# Kipa Discord Bot

"kipa" is a custom discord.js v12 bot, made fully by aymhh.


## Installation

Simply download this bot and setup the `indiscriminate` folder next to the `index.js` file.

Make another folder inside the `indiscriminate` directory named `transcripts` to make the transcripts command work

Inside the `indiscriminate` directory make another file named `config.json` and paste this below:
```json
{
    "prefix": "set your prefix",
    "token": "token goes here",
    "color": "set your color (hex code)",
    "commands": "name of your commands channel name",
    "logChannelName": "name of your logging channel name",
    "punishmentChannel": "name of your punishment channel name"
}
```
Set up the prefix, token, color, channel names within the quotation marks...

Watch a simple video on how to get the bot up, as I will not be explaining that here.
